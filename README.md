# PetSite.com

At petsite.com, an organisation established on 20th June 2021, we make sure that we provide the facility of procuring pets to all of you in the most human, sensitive and safe manner during these covid times.

We have stores all over the country that work hand in hand to educate you with all the pets available and their nature in the best way possible to people all over the country.

Sanitization facilities and regular tests of all the animals, delivery boys and store owners are taken. The animals have been pre vaccinated before we give them to you. We also provide the delivery boy with rabies and various other animal disease's vaccinations and train them to vaccinate you whilst being in your home's.
